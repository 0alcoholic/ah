5. Comparision Of AngularJS - Angular4

		  AngularJS - reactJS

		  AngularJS - NodeJS


What is AngularJS
-----------------

	- AngularJS is the Client Side JavaScript

Framework.

	- AngularJS Follows the MVC Design Pattern.

M - Model

Ex.
	var data = "data from database soon....!";


[Note : where "data" variable called as model in angularjs]


V - View

	- we can use HTML / HTML5 as the View in AngularJS.


C - Controller

	we can call JavaScript Functions as the Controller

        in angularJS.


Ex.
	function my_fun(){

		//Logic Goes Here
	}





[Note : where "my_fun()" called as Controller in 
	angularJS]


Advantages Of AngularJS:
------------------------

1. AngularJS Supports Modules.
	(Predefined Modules && Custom Modules)


	- ngAnimate
		- this module used to develop the Animations
		  in angular applications.


	- ngMessages
		- this module used to handle the client side
                  form validations.
		
	- ngStorage
		- this module used to work with the Storages.

		- we have two types of storages.

			1. local storage

			2. session storage
		local storage:
		--------------

			- as a developer we must destroy the local storage
	         	  explicitely

			- local storage is the permanent storage.

			- we can save maximum "5MB Data" in local storage		

		session storage:
		----------------

			- when ever we "close the browser" or 
			  "opens the new tab"
                          data will be lost from session storage.

			- session storage is the temparary storage.
			
			- we can save maximum 5MB Data in Session Storage.


		ngRoute:
		--------
			- it is used to implement the Routing in
                          Single Page Application.
			
			- ngRoute Module is the Default Module
                          (Native Module).

			- now a days "no project" using ngRoute Module
			  
			- "ngRoute" Module is the Deprecated Module.

		ui.router:
		----------
			- this module used to implement the Routing
                          in Single Page Application.

			- ui.router module is the 3rd party module.

			- now a days all most all the projects using
			  ui.router module because of it's advantages.

		

Ex.
	implement the angular application with following features.

		1. Client Side Form Validations   (ngMessages)

		2. Storages Support		  (ngStorage)

		3. Animations Support		  (ngAnimate)

		4. Single Page Applications	  (ui.router) 
		   by using 3rd party Module.
		
		
index.html
----------
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html ng-app="app">

	<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/
	             angularjs/1.6.0/angular.min.js"></script>


	<script>
		var obj = angular.module("app",["ngMessages",
				      "ngStorage",
				       "ngAnimate",
					"ui.router"]);
	</script>
</html>


		
2. Open Source Code

	- As per our project Requirement we can customize the 
	  framework

		Ex.
			adding the features
			modifying the features
			deleting the features
